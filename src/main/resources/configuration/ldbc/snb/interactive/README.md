# Query frequencies

This directory contains the frequencies of the complex read queries prescribed for each scale factor. Audited runs must use these frequencies.

Note that the `.properties` files in this directory are partial ones, i.e. they need to combined with the sample `.properties` files provided in the `driver/` directory of each implementation (e.g. [`/postgres/driver/benchmark.properties`](/postgres/driver/benchmark.properties)).
